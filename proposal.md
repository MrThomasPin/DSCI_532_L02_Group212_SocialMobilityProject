## DSCI 532 Group 212 Proposal: Social Mobility Project

### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

In an ideal world, every child would have the opportunity to achieve success regardless of what social class they happened to be born into. 
Having a low potential for socio-economic mobility means that a child's ultimate life prospects are more or less predetermined by the education or income level of thier parents, whereas a high mobility is an indication of an equal-opportunity society.  Research has shown that higher social mobility also leads to increased economic growth and social stability (Source: [GDIM, 2018]()).  We feel that this makes it a better metric for measuring societal success over other traditional factors such as GDP.
We are proposing to build a visualization app that uses educational mobility as a proxy for overall socio-economic mobility to show how it has changed globally over the last four generations. The app will feature a global map that will allow users to get a big-picture view for each generation along with the ability to get specific information for any country.  The app will also include interactive plots where the user can select countries or regions to compare more closely.  Later in this proposal we describe how this could be used by policy makers to inform decisions around investments in education and promoting equality.
