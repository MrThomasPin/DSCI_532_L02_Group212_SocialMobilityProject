# DSCI_532_L02_Group212_SocialMobilityProject


Holly Williams, Aakanksha Dimri, and Thomas Pin's DSCI 532 dashboard project on international social mobility. 

## Description of our app & sketch 

In an ideal world, every child would have the opportunity to achieve success regardless of what social class they happened to be born into. In other words, everyone would have unlimited potential for upward socio-economic mobility and their fate would not be pre-determined by their parent's income, education, or class.  

This visualization app uses educational mobility as a proxy for overall socio-economic mobility to show how it has changed globally over the last four generations. The app will feature a global map that will allow users to get a big-picture view for a selected generation along with the ability to get specific information for any country. There is a bar chart next to the plot showing the overall ranking of all countries for the selected generation.  Below the map, the app will include three interactive plots where the user can select two countries or regions to compare against each other more closely in terms of overall education index, education index for men and women, and overall ranking.
