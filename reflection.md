# Reflection

## Feedback

We received some feedback on Friday that we did not have time to fully incorporate. This included:
 - Changing the titles of your line plots. (This is tricky with faceted plots, but could be a later improvement.)
 - Making the bar plot bigger. (Right now the bar plot is linked to the map and has to be around the same height otherwise it will result in a lot of white space. 
 
We did add a reference to the data source and a brief explanation of the index. We will update our sketch for the next milestone.

We also received some suggestions from peers and partners that improved the usability of our app. For example, one of our partners suggested adding some text to our app to let users know that they can use `shift+click` to select multiple items on the map and bar chart.

## App Critique

### What it does well

We think our app is clean and concise without a lot of superfluous information. The interactive features have all been designed with specific purposes in mind, and not just for the sake of it. 

### Limitations

Some limitations of our app include:
 - it only includes information on education mobility
 - countries with `NaN` values do not show up on the plot (spent a ridiculous amount of hours trying to troubleshoot this to no avail)
 - small countries are hard to see on the map

### Future Improvements and Additions

Potential additions / improvements include:
 - adding more data on overall income mobility and indicators of mobility to be able to dig into deeper research questions
 - making the map interactive (zoomable), or faceting by continent
 - adding a selection filter to the bar chart to be able to filter the number of countries shown (i.e. top 20, bottom 10, etc)
 - changing the titles of line plots
