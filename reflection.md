# Reflection

## Feedback

We did not receive any feedback from the TAs to incorporate. We did, however, receive some suggestions from peers and partners that improved the usability of our app. For example, one of our partners suggested adding some text to our app to let users know that they can use `shift+click` to select multiple items on the map and bar chart.

## App Critique

### What it does well

We think our app is clean and concise without a lot of superfluous information. The interactive features have all been designed with specific purposes in mind, and not just for the sake of it. 

### Limitations

Some limitations of our app include:
 - it only includes information on education mobility
 - countries with `NaN` values do not show up on the plot (spent a ridiculous amount of hours trying to troubleshoot this to no avail)
 - small countries are hard to see on the map

### Future Improvements and Additions

Potential additions / improvements include:
 - adding more data on overall income mobility and indicators of mobility to be able to dig into deeper research questions
 - making the map interactive (zoomable), or faceting by continent
 - adding a selection filter to the bar chart to be able to filter the number of countries shown (i.e. top 20, bottom 10, etc)
