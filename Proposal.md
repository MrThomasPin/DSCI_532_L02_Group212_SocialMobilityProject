## Usage Scenario

Professor Moriarty, a well reputed Sociology professor in UBC, is exploring different ways to make his class’s term paper more
engaging. The TA assigned with this endeavour, was coincidentally also the TA for MDS. The TA decided to use an app created 
by MDS students which enables one to visualise trends in the education index globally. The app would provide the sociology 
students with ample oppurtunity to look further into the trends in education index across the globe for their term paper. 

Tanvi a Sociology major, when using the app will land on an interactive map of the world encompassing the education index
for all given geographies across four generations. The app enables her to visualise a comprehensive global database collected 
on intergenerational mobility using education index as a proxy for social upliftment in the countries. 

By hovering over a region, she can get the education index for a chosen generation for any country. The histogram on the right 
will further aid her insight by providing the global rank of this country for the chosen generation. She would also be able
to identify whether the country is deemed a developing economy or a high-income economy. 

For ex. If she chooses 1940, She might observe that South Africa has the highest education index amongst all African countries.
In fact, it is at par with the developed economies of the time. This could lead her to choose South Africa as her country of 
interest and then formulate a deeper insight into South Africa’s progress over generations and compare it to other countries. 

The bottom half of the dashboard would enable her to perform this task using a more granular approach. From the drop down menu
she can choose to compare South Africa with, say USA. This would also provide her with information with regard to the changes 
in education index for men and women separately. For ex. she might notice that for South Africa, the education index 
fell for the first three generations and then displayed minor improvements. On the other hand, it rose consistently for USA.
However, the education index of women, though historically disadvantaged, has an upward trend in the last generation for 
both countries. 

With this information in hand, she decides to write her paper on the impact of woman’s education on the upward mobility of
a generation as a whole. In future, she can further build upon this by combining this dataset with the Gap Minder project,
to investigate the correlation between a country’s average per capita GDP and its maternal education index.
